# Figure 3C â€“ Correlation between subsampled Cambray and Goodman log odds

This folder contains the necessary data, scripts, and output files to recreate Figure 3C, which assesses whether correcting for equal sample sizes changes the correlation coefficient between the Goodman et al (2013) and Cambray et al (2018) data set.

To do this, the Cambray data set (244,000 transgenes) was randomly sub-sampled 1000 times to calculate the log odds of ~14,000 constructs (similar sample size to the Goodman data set). Each sub-sample log odds was then averaged and this was then compared to the Goodman trans log odds data set using Pearson correlation.

## Plot 

The correlation coefficient between the log odds from the sub-sampled Cambray data set and the Goodman data set are unchanged compared when using the pre-subsampled Cambray data set. This indicates the differences in sampling size is not contributing to the observed AGG paradox in Goodman et al (2013)

## To regenerate the figure

1. To calculate subsampled Cambray log odds averages, run in python:

   ```bash
   python Sub_sample_Cambray.py

2. To generate the plot:

    ```r
    source("XY_Correlation_Sub_sampled_Cambray_Goodman.r")
    ```
