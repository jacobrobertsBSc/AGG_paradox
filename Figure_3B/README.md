# Figure 3B â€“ Correlation between Goodman and Cambray log odds

This folder contains the necessary data, scripts, and output files to recreate Figure 3B, this assesses whether the codon enrichment log odds observed in Cambray et al (2018) are predictive of those from Goodman et al (2013).

## Plot

![Figure 3B](Figure_3B.png)

The pearson correlation coefficient appears lower than what is expected, considering they are both measuring translation efficiency. The AGG codon is one of the least predicted codons with regards to the Cambray et al (2018) data set.
