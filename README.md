# The AGG_paradox

# Understanding the association of AGG codons with highly expressed genes, an artifact or an enigma? 

Here, we investigate the biological relevance of a paradoxical association between the arginine codon **AGG** and high gene expression. This result was originally observed in [Goodman et al., 2013] and contradicts a widely supported theory suggesting that codons which promote stable mRNA secondary structures (G/C rich) suppress protein expression by hinderingg translation initiation (Allert, Cox, & Hellinga, 2010; Bentele et al., 2013; Cambray, Guimaraes & Arkin, 2018; Osterman et al., 2020; Nieuwkoop et al., 2023).

This project begins by analysing the **Goodman et al. (2013)** data set and then moving onto investigating if this paradox is observed in larger transgene data sets produced by **Cambray et al. (2018)** and **Osterman et al. (2020)**. We also assess whether differences in **sampling size**, **experimental design**, or **culture conditions** may account for an artifactual association of the AGG codons with high expression.
